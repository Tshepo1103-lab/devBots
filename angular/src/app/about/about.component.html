            A time management system for a company is a comprehensive tool designed to track and optimize employees' working hours. This system allows organizations to accurately record the time each employee spends on various tasks and projects. By capturing detailed time logs, the system helps in monitoring attendance, managing work schedules, and ensuring compliance with labor regulations. It also facilitates productivity analysis by providing insights into how work hours are allocated across different activities. This data is invaluable for generating payroll, identifying areas for efficiency improvement, and making informed decisions about resource allocation. Overall, a time management system streamlines the process of tracking work hours, enhances operational efficiency, and supports effective workforce management.
